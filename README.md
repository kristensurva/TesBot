# TesBot
This Discord bot is designed to perform two main functions: counting the occurrences of a specified string across all messages in a server and generating random or specific quotes from the server's users. The bot is primarily written in JavaScript, while the analytical part and tabular display are powered by the Python Pandas library.

## Features
### count \<string\>
* Count and display the number of occurrences of a specified string across all messages in the server.
* Generate a table ordered by the number of times the string has been used for each user in the server. <br>
